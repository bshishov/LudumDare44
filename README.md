Ludum Dare #44 game jam entry.

## Description:
Sometimes the best way to avoid one’s grave is to put someone else in it! You play as a descendant of a mighty bloodline of Blood Harvesters. Power through the lines of enemies. Claim their power as your own! Choose the skills which suit you best. Consume the blood from fallen enemies and use it to cast powerful spells. Be wary, however, for your flesh can only contain a limited pool of blood.

## Gameplay
Kill enemies and fill the bar, responsible for summoning boss. Obliterate him as well. Repeat. You have three slots for your abilities. Enemies can drop abilities on death, giving you the opportunity to pick up different ability or enhance the current one.
You can also buy items at the shop. They can increase your parameters, but they cost you your health cap!
You can have lots of same abilities/in the stack, which increases their effectiveness.
